/// A Cargo fingerprint. This struct is vendored and modified from the Cargo
/// source code. In particular, some `serde(skip)`ed fields are elided. For
/// details, see the module documentation[^1] and the struct definition[^2].
///
/// We parse and rewrite fingerprints because they are non-relocatable. In
/// particular, the `path` field is an absolute path for crates whose base
/// source file is located outside of the workspace root, including packages
/// downloaded from the crates.io registry. On save, we rewrite this path to be
/// relative to `CARGO_HOME`, and on restore, we rewrite this field with the
/// correct source path for the destination machine. Note that because this
/// changes the fingerprint hash on relocation, this also changes the `deps`
/// field of all downstream dependents, which must also then have their
/// fingerprints rewritten.
///
/// All Cargo units (library compilation, build script compilation, and build
/// script execution) have corresponding fingerprint directories, located at
/// `{profile}/.fingerprint/{package_name}-{unit_hash}`. Within these
/// directories, this fingerprint struct's hash is saved in the
/// `{kind}-{crate_name}` file, and a JSON serialization of its data is saved in
/// `{kind}-{crate_name}.json`.
///
/// Fingerprints are generated when `prepare_target`[^3] is called (which is the
/// main fingerprint logic entrypoint called by
/// `cargo::core::compiler::compile`), and their saved location is defined in
/// `fingerprint_file_path`[^4].
