/// A third-party Cargo dependency for cache identification.
///
/// Contains the minimal set of information needed to uniquely identify
/// a dependency across different workspaces and machines for caching purposes.
/// Each dependency gets cached independently based on its cache key.
///
/// ## Cache Key Components
/// All fields contribute to the cache key generation:
/// - `name`: Crate name from `Cargo.lock`
/// - `version`: Exact version from `Cargo.lock`
/// - `checksum`: Registry checksum ensuring content integrity
/// - `target`: Compilation target (e.g., `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`)
///
/// ## Contract
/// - Only represents third-party dependencies from the default registry
/// - Cache keys must match exactly for artifacts to be reused
/// - Target triple ensures platform-specific artifacts aren't mixed
///
/// ## TODO
/// - We probably need to move to a model where we search for matching caches
///   based on the elements in this instead of opaque cache keys.
/// - We aren't including things that should almost definitely be included,
///   for example active features.

    ///    an rlib called `libxml`[^2] and the package `build-rs` used to name
    ///    its library crate `build`[^3].
    /// 2. In packages whose names are not valid Rust identifiers (in
    ///    particular, packages with hyphens in their names), Cargo will
    ///    automatically convert the library crate name into a Rust identifier
    ///    by converting hyphens into underscores[^1].
