-- Cargo cache: stores SavedUnit instances as JSONB.
--
-- This table uses a JSONB-based approach for simplicity and flexibility:
-- - SavedUnit types are directly serialized to JSONB without decomposition
-- - cache_key is a stable hash of SavedUnitCacheKey (includes unit hash + libc version)
-- - unit_hash and libc_version are stored separately for compatibility-based lookups
-- - No impedance mismatch: Rust types ARE the storage format
-- - Future-proof: Adding fields to SavedUnitCacheKey doesn't require schema changes
--
-- Access pattern for compatibility-based restore:
-- - Save: INSERT complete SavedUnit by cache_key, also store unit_hash and libc_version
-- - Restore: SELECT by unit_hash, filter by libc compatibility
--
-- File contents are stored in CAS (deduplicated), JSONB only stores metadata.
