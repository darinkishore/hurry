## Invocation Sketch

When `hurry cargo build` is run:

1. Compute the workspace identifier.
2. Gather information about the workspace, used to select the appropriate cache key using the workspace cache manifest (if one exists).

> [!NOTE]
> Information about the workspace is gathered from many sources but in general they are something like (but not necessarily limited to):
> - Platform and CPU architecture
> - `cargo`/`rustc` version
> - `cargo`/`rustc` invocation flags
> - Hashed content of files on disk
>
> Different facts about the workspace have different levels of precedence when it comes to selecting the "most similar" cache key in the event of a non-exact match. For example, it is _almost_ useless to restore the cache for a system that is an entirely different platform and architecture. We may still do it if we detect potential reuse such as e.g. `sqlx` or other macro invocations which may actually be reused across different platforms and architectures in some contexts.

3. If an exact match cache key is found, restore its contents to the workspace.
4. If no exact match cache key is found, restore the closest match cache key to the workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> Restoring the contents to the workspace in effect means "copy the contents of the cache directory to the `target/` directory in the workspace". However, this "copy" operation is done in a few different ways; reference the "Storage" section below for more information.

5. Run the build with `cargo`.
6. If the build succeeds and the cache was not an exact match, store the current state of the workspace into the CAS and create a new cache key reference for this state of the repository.

## Storage

`hurry` stores a user-local cache at `~/.cache/hurry`. For Rust, the current layout of this cache is:

```
~/.cache/hurry/v1/cargo/
├── ws/
│   ├── <workspace_identifier>
│   │   ├── lock
│   │   ├── manifest.json
│   │   └── <cache_key>/
│   └── ...
└── cas/
    ├── <object_b3sum>
    └── ...
```

Each `<workspace_identifier>` uniquely identifies a "logical" workspace.
The idea is that when users are working with e.g. git submodules or other similar systems where the same workspace is checked out at different paths, `hurry` will treat them as the same workspace, allowing cache reuse. This identifier is platform and machine independent, allowing for cache reuse across machines (e.g. CI or different developer systems).

The `lock` file is used to ensure that the workspace is not modified while a single instance of `hurry` is running. This is a hack; we will probably eventually replace this with atomic filesystem operations.

The `manifest.json` contains information about the workspace such as the hashes of the source files, cache keys (and what they represent), and the target directory. The idea here is that you can't just blindly rely on a single cache key for reliable cross-platform and cross-machine builds. Instead, we record metadata about the cache keys so that if there's not an exact match `hurry` can find the closest match to restore. `hurry` is built with a "fail-closed" architecture, meaning that if it restores a cache that is slightly incorrect, `cargo` or `rustc` will simply rebuild the parts that are missing.

Finally, the `<cache_key>` directories contain the actual build artifacts inside a given cache; these are equivalent to the `target` directory in a workspace. Each directory is made up of symlinks from the `cas` directory so that common files are able to be shared across multiple cache keys instead of duplicating space on disk.

When `hurry` is run in a workspace and needs to restore the cache, its behavior differs by platform:
- If Copy-On-Write functionality is available on the file system, it prefers that.
- If OverlayFS is available, it falls back to that in order to simulate Copy-On-Write.
- Otherwise, it falls back to a simple symlink approach.

## Native Rust builds

In order for `hurry` to integrate with `cargo`/`rust`, we need to understand how their builds work. This section explains how they work to the best of our understanding. The intention is to provide multiple purposes:
- Demonstrate to users that we actually understand how `cargo` and `rustc` work.
  - Of course, as a corrolary, provide a place for other experts in this space to correct any misunderstandings we may have.
  - If you're this person, we'd love to hear from you!
- Provide a place for our core assumptions to be documented.
  - Since this is our understanding of the baseline, all design decisions made in the product are based on this understanding.
- Accelerate onboarding for new contributors by providing a centralized resource for learning about `cargo` and `rustc` builds.

### `target/` organization

TODO: Figure out the minimum version of `cargo` and `rustc` that `hurry` supports. To begin with it'll probably be whatever version uses the observed layout we're working with, but over time we may need to add support for changes made in older (or newer!) versions.

> [!NOTE]
> Source for this: [Rust compiler docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/core/compiler/layout/index.html).

### Incremental third-party builds

TODO: What steps does `cargo` and `rustc` take to build incremental third-party crates?

TODO: My understanding today is that third-party crates are not actually built incrementally in the same way that first party crates are. Instead, they're always built fully, and an "incremental" third party build is really just "some of the third party dependencies have changed since the last build" (or similar- e.g. "the local rust compiler has changed" or "the rust flags have changed" also trigger rebuilds of third party crates). Is this correct?
