## Nudge

This project uses [Nudge](https://github.com/attunehq/nudge), a collaborative partner that helps you remember coding conventions. Nudge watches your `Write` and `Edit` operations and reminds you about patterns and preferences that matter here—so you can focus on the actual problem instead of tracking stylistic details.

**Nudge is on your side.** When it sends you a message, it's not a reprimand—it's a colleague tapping you on the shoulder. The messages are direct (sometimes blunt) because that's what cuts through when you're focused. Trust the feedback and adjust; if a rule feels wrong, mention it so we can fix the rule.

**Writing new rules:** If the user asks you to add or modify Nudge rules, run `nudge claude docs` to see the rule format, template variables, and guidelines for writing effective messages.
